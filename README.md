Notepad App.

From author:
I didnt fixed out the gist so I installed my own rest server based on node json-server(unfortunately last one have no multiple update possibility).
I had no experience with react and redux, I choosed them because that was interesting for me to made it in hard context.
I needed 10 hours of work for this.
I had no time to make right html bootstrap and implement title part.

1. Necessary dependency: nodejs
2. Install process: npm install
3. To start dev server, write command npm start.
4. To start prod, write command npm run build.
5. Webpack is configured to work with SCSS and bootstrap.
6. Webpack is also prepared to write tests and run them, via jest.

P.S.This is really not the best my code, and is not even close to being it, just I'm not good with test writing ;))
